# ongardie's config files

This repo contains some configuration files, mostly for Linux/UNIX systems.
Some of these will require manual tweaking, but these give me a head start
when I'm configuring a new machine. You might find useful snippets in here,
too.

Some of the files in this repo begin with a dot, so use `ls -a` to see them.

To use these files, you can copy or symlink them in place, or in some cases
you can "include" them.
