This directory contains configuration files for the
[Notion window manager](https://notionwm.net/). The Lua files should go into
`~/.notion/`. The `make_look.sh` script can be used to replace the font size
in the default theme file.

Many of the configuration files are based on those that ship with Notion, but
the keybindings have been heavily customized (mostly to resemble older versions
of Notion and other window managers I used long ago). Most of the context
menu configuration is unchanged from Notion and split into `*_menu.lua`
files.

Notion v4, on which these files are based, is licensed under the LGPLv2.1.

To get a graphical overview of the keybindings in your web browser, type
`META + /'.
