# `auto` package

This `auto` package shadows the one built into Cubicle. It's an implicit
dependency of all interactive cubicle environments. It depends on:
- `apt-binary` from Cubicle,
- [`configs`](../configs/README.md) from this repo, and
- `git-user`, which you should customize from
  [`git-user-template`](../git-user-template/README.md).
