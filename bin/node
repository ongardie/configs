#!/bin/sh

# This script acts as `node`, `npm`, and `npx` from the NodeJS project. It
# determines which version to execute by looking up the filesystem for a
# `.nvmrc` file with a version number in it. If that version is not installed
# in `~/opt/``, it downloads and installs it. Then it executes the invoked
# binary.

# In other words, this is a slightly more magical and more opinionated version
# of the Node Version Manager at https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm. Note that this
# script only understands `.nvmrc` files with version numbers (not "lts/*" and
# such).
